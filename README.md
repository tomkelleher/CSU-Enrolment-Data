# CSU-Enrolment-Data
California State University enrolment data in open formats.

This data was previously made publically available by the California State University (CSU) system. Please see the following URL for the source data:
http://www.calstate.edu/as/stats.shtml

The CSU currently only makes this data available in HTML table format. (See the above URL.) The instructions to import the data into Excel only works on Windows, and the resulting data requires additional transformation to be easily used for further analysis. As a result, I have decided to make my conversions of the data openly available. If you have any questions, or concerns, please feel free to contact me.
